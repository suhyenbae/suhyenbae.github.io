Hello! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at Duke University.
------

My research explores the changing character of social and political networks and their effects on political attitudes and behavior. Her dissertation investigates the role of loneliness in politics, particularly in relation to political participation offline and online. She uses large-scale surveys and survey experiments to distinguish between temporal and chronic dimensions of loneliness. Her work is supported by the APSA Dissertation Grant (DDRIG). Additionally, her research extends to topics on ideological asymmetry in mental health, community embeddedness, and the interplay between affective and cognitive elements in voting behavior. In the The Fundamental Voter (2024) my coauthors and I identify five fundamental forces shaping the American electorate by broadening the partisan cleavage and consequently fostering a growing emotional reaction.
