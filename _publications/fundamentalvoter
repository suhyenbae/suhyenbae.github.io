permalink: /publication/fundamentalvoter
excerpt: 'Why is American politics so intense and emotionally competitive today, and how did we get here? In The Fundamental Voter, we explain why the notion that we are divided into tribal loyalties is, at best, only partially correct, and discuss how the divisions rest on much more substantive politics than they once did.'
